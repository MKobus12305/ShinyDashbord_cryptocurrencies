### Menu
The application is divided into three main parts: 
- Basics
- Compare cryptocurrencies
- Datatable

The menu section, placed on the left side of the application, gives the possibility to move freely between these parts, as well as to obtain basic information about the project (About) or get help in navigating the site (Help).

### Basics

In addition to the plots, the top of the page will also show the basic data in coloured boxes.


### Compare cryptocurrencies

Once you have selected the values mentioned above, press the 'Apply' button to view the plots.
In addition to the plots, the top of the page will also show the basic data in coloured boxes.


### Datatable
