# ShinyDashbord_cryptocurrencies
## Interactive Shiny dashboard showing cryptocurrencies analysis  
This application was created for the Data Visualization course as an assignment in creating interactive dashboards, using R and the Shiny and ShinyDashboards libraries. 
It is intended to allow the user to perform basic analysis, as well as to compare two cryptocurrencies, their marketcap and value, and their minimum and maximum values.

As of today, the data is historical, obtained thanks to the dataset on the [Kaggle] website, but eventually the application will be expanded to be able to track current information on cryptocurrencies from the exchange.
